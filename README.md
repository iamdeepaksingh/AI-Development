## Data Classification

Data Classification on Titanic dataset using **Autokeras** and **TensorFlow**. I used Google Colab for runtime execution.

Below are the high level steps which can be followed.

- Step1: Import the necessary libraries

- Step2: Upload and explore the dataset. Use sklearn to split into test and train dataset.

- Step3: Create a classifier using autokeras

- Step4: Train the model. AutoMl will try different models and parameters and choose the best model

- Step5: Evaluate the Model for Accuracy

- Step6: Test the model with some input to predict.
